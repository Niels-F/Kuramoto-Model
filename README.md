# Kuramoto Model â€“ Synchronization Dynamics in Photonic Neural Systems

This repository presents my work on the Kuramoto model (Master 2 - Student Project).
## ðŸ“˜ Overview

The goal of this project was to explore how the **Kuramoto model** can be used to study **synchronization dynamics** in coupled systems â€” specifically, in **vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs)**, which are key components in **photonic neural networks**.

By simulating the collective behavior of these systems, I aimed to gain a numerical understanding of synchronization mechanisms and their dependence on system parameters, external inputs, and coupling strengths. This complements the work of a colleague focused on **training physical neural networks**, by providing a simulation-based perspective on synchronization.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The project is divided into **two main phases**:

### ðŸ”¹ Phase 1 â€” Alpha Version
- Developed and tested a basic Kuramoto model to understand its natural dynamics.
- Explored an *upgraded* version of the model with modified coupling behavior.

### ðŸ”¹ Phase 2 â€” Beta Version
- Investigated how synchronization evolves with different parameters (e.g. coupling strength, frequency spread).
- Introduced **external input signals** to observe the systemâ€™s response under injection-like conditions.
- 
## ðŸ““ Notebooks

All code is provided as **Jupyter notebooks**, organized for clarity and reproducibility.

You will find **one main notebook (Jupyter)**, with three main code:
1. Alpha version â€“ Standard Kuramoto model implementation.
2. Mix between Alpha & Beta versionâ€“ Upgraded model with advanced coupling.
3. Beta versionâ€“ Includes an external input signal.


## ðŸ“‘ Report

The reader is strongly encouraged to read the **full technical report** attached to this repository.

In the report, I detail:
- The theoretical foundation behind the Kuramoto model.
- How synchronization phenomena emerge in coupled oscillator systems.
- The relevance to real-world photonic devices like VCSELs and optical reservoirs.
